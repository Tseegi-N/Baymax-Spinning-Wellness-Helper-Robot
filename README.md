# Baymax: Spinning Wellness Helper Robot
## This is a final project for CSC 233: Electronics and Arduino 

My inspiration for this project came from Baymax, the lovable and helpful healthcare companion robot from Disney’s Big Hero 6. I wanted to make something that was both playful and technically rich, an homage to a character that brings comfort, especially to fans of animation like myself. I drew loosely from Maker Boi’s [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpOxjXaVGrg&ab_channel=MakerBoi), where a mini Baymax inflates out of his iconic red case when someone says “ow.” Instead of relying on voice activation, my version allows Baymax to interact based on inputs like *pain level* (via buttons) and *temperature* (via sensor), and to respond visually through an *LCD display* and *physical spinning motion*. 

## Material and Components
To bring Baymax to life, I used two Arduino breadboards, jumper wires, an nMos transistor, two potentiometer, a 9V battery, a DC motor, resistors, three pushbuttons, a diode, an LCD screen, and a temperature sensor. For the physical structure, I used white LEGO pieces and a wooden base from the engineering playground. Baymax’s body parts were 3D printed at DTI, and I collaborated with Eric from CDF to create an air pump prototype using materials like a balloon, pen pipe, and DC motor. While I ultimately didn’t use the air pump in the final project, the process gave me insight into air mechanisms and motor-driven systems.

Please refer to the Tinkercad design circuit diagram, design sketch photos, and code for technical implementation of the project.
